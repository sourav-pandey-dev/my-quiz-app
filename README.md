# Quiz App

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This is a responsive, single-page **Quiz Application** built with **React + Vite**, styled using **Tailwind CSS**.  
The app assesses front-end fundamentals by demonstrating **state management, API integration, and a clean, user-friendly interface**.

The application presents multiple-choice questions fetched from the **Open Trivia Database API**, tracks the user's score, and displays a summary of the results at the end.  
It also includes a **timer for each question** and a **persistent high-score feature**.
